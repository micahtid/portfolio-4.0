The platform enables organizations to post onsite and remote internship and volunteer opportunities, review applicants, and select candidates efficiently. On the flip side, high school students can easily browse opportunities and apply for positions that match their interests and skills. As lead developer, I managed both the frontend and backend architecture, directing a team of three developers and a social media manager. The platform integrated cutting-edge features including email notifications and Stripe subscriptions for premium organization accounts. Unfortunately, despite building strong initial traction, the project was eventually halted due to limited market reach in this niche sector.",

The core feature is a proprietary compatibility algorithm that calculates match scores based on detailed profile data, enabling students to discover and connect with those most similar to them. The platform allows students to send chat requests, engage in real-time conversations, and join virtual study rooms together powered by Zoom integration. As lead developer working alongside one co-developer, I focused primarily on backend development and architecture‚Äîdesigning robust database schemas for chat data, implementing real-time messaging systems, and integrating third-party APIs. The platform built impressive momentum with a waitlist exceeding 1,000 users, but was ultimately halted due to resource constraints.",

This was a comprehensive project that involved creating multiple pages showcasing the nonprofit's branches, board members, blog content, impact stories, and more. Beyond the public-facing website, I developed a robust administrative backend panel that enables staff members to easily manage dynamic content without technical knowledge. The platform seamlessly integrates multiple third-party APIs including Google Maps for location services and Instagram for social media feeds. This experience taught me valuable lessons about working with non-profit organizations, managing complex requirements, and building user-friendly solutions for both public users and internal staff.",
